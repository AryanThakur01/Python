New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday came down on the DMK for some of its statements on the issue of freebies, saying the judiciary is "responsible" and the "wisdom does not belong to a particular party or a particular person". 
A bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana, during the hearing of a PIL against "irrational" freebies, rapped DMK, the moment its counsel P Wilson, who is also DMK MP, commenced his submissions.

Some leaders of the party have been reportedly making statements on the issue of freebies and the judicial intervention on the ground that welfare measures are for uplifting marginalised people and cannot be held as "freebies".

"Mr Wilson (senior advocate P Wilson, counsel for DMK), I am sorry to say this. I wanted to say so many things. But I am not saying so being the Chief Justice of India. The party and the minister which he (a lawyer) is talking about...I don't think that wisdom only belongs to a particular person or a particular party. We are also responsible..," the Chief Justice said.
